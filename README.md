## Data Models
### Vessel Class
The `Vessel` class represents a vessel with the following properties:
- `Id` (int): The unique identifier for the vessel, autogenerated.
- `ImoNumber` (string): The IMO number of the vessel.
- `OwnerId` (int?): The ID of the owner, nullable to allow for vessels without an owner.

### Owner Class
The `Owner` class represents an owner with the following properties:
- `Id` (int): The unique identifier for the owner, autogenerated.
- `FirstName` (string): The first name of the owner.
- `LastName` (string): The last name of the owner.
- **Navigation Property**: A collection of vessels owned by the owner.

## Entity Framework Core Configuration
The application uses Entity Framework Core with the code-first approach to define the database schema. The relationships between the `Vessel` and `Owner` classes are configured using Fluent API.

## Usage
